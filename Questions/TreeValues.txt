Tree-Values
You are given a tree  consisting of  nodes. The tree is rooted at node . Now, for each node  of this tree where , you need to find the maximum distance between  nodes lying in subtree of node .

We call the distance between  nodes to be the number of edges lying on the unique path between them.

Input Format:

The first line contains a single integer  denoting the number of nodes in tree . Each of the next  lines contains  space separated integers  and , denoting an edge between nodes  and  in tree .

It is guaranteed the given input edges form a valid tree.

Output Format:

Print  space separated integers, where the  integer denotes the answer for node .

Constraints:

Sample Input
4
1 2
1 3
2 4
Sample Output
3 1 0 0
Explanation
For the node  , the path from node  to  is largest in its subtree. For node  the path from node  to  is largest in its subtree. For the other nodes this length is zero as there are no edges in the subtrees of those nodes.

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
